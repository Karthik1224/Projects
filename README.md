# Projects
I have developed a frontend Based Web Application which is Priority Based ToDoList using HTML5,CSS3 and JavaScript etc.
Here in this project, the user will create a task and select priority from the scroll down option(i,e low,medium, high).
Now the table , will be containing tasks along with the priorites entered by the user.
Below the table, we have filter section which contains 4 buttons(low,medium,high and all), they are used to fetch the data from the table;
for ex: when we click medium priority button from the filter section, only that priority tasks are visible in the table, hiding the other priority tasks.
